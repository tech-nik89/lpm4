<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You successfully completed the setup of the LAN Party Manager IV. The ApfelSOFT team wishes a lot of fun with our product, we keep the fingers crossed. Now, you can log in with your recently created admin account and fill everything with groovy content.</p>
<p style="border:1px solid #ABABAB; padding:4px;"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
Please remove the install directory and the install.php from the file system, just to prevent problems.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
We recommend to assign first all rights to the group <em>Admin</em>. It works like this: First, log in with your account, click <em>Admin</em> and then <em>Groups</em>. Click <em>Edit</em> and select all checkboxes. Finally, click <em>Save</em>.</p>
<p>It also woudn't be very efficient if somebody removes all admin users or all groups. In this case, it would be essential to manipulate the database.</p>
